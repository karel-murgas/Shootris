TODO:
* Clean up code
* When destroying cell, brighter flash fo a moment (50ms?)
* Frame upgoing blob (not individual cells) 
* Universal ammo
* Ammo of two colors
* Setting & difficulties
* Handle potential errors


Fails:
Exe file - I need a help with this! (Python 3.5, Pyinstaller doesn't work (even when commenting out the pictures) - it creates exe, which crashes to desktop)


Code cleaning ideas:
* Lables as instances of class
** Name, positon (top), flashing (time, status), rect
** Flashing effect, writing


* It's possible to extend parent method! So I can extend kill() to do some cool effects! (define it as a new method + call parent method in it - Tobi's explosions will be possible
* Background (used by clear) will start as black; when cell is killed, it blits rect of BGIMG to that surgace
* At game over - background will fade into black
* At win - background will fade in to full picture

Hit:
1) Check up blob first. If true, groupcollide(ub, mb) -> change to set (to remove duplicities), change to list, exclude Nones and call destroy on that list (don't forget to kill up blob)
2) If miss, check the main blob. If hit, call destruction on that cell. Return (with others), if explosion hitted the up blob. If true, do step 1.

Destroy:
BFS - queue of cells to destroy - take one, None it's neighbours and add them to queue
Killable neighbours - method of cell
Ignore upblob (handled elsewhere)

return:
cells: list (group die_slowly?)
kill_upblob: bool

None them:
change matrix to None
Can't kill them - I need them to move with old group
add them to slowly_dying group

Die_slowly:
Each cell has lifetime
If lifetime <= 0 -> kill it
Else - update color


* solve color - none with upblob - none with upblob - color chain (check neighbours while killing upblob? spread even through dead blobs if they are covered?)



*RPG model:
** Finishing levels gives you points and you can buy upgrades with them
** You can choose level (harder levels = more points)
** Upgrades like better ammo (universal, double)
** Skills (after pressing key something happens - maib_blob stopped for x second, recolor blob_part, delete row, move upgoing blob to side...)
