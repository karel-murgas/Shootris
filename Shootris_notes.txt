TODO:
* Clean up code
* When destroying cell, brighter flash for a moment (50ms?)
* Universal ammo
* Ammo of two colors
* Setting & difficulties (menu)
* Allow adding new backgrounds and themes just by copiing them
* Center background (if size does not fit)
* Handle potential errors


Fails:
* Exe file - I need a help with this! (Python 3.5, Pyinstaller doesn't work (even when commenting out the pictures) - it creates exe, which crashes to desktop)
* First successful shot lags the game. I have no idea why.


Code cleaning ideas:
* Lables as instances of class
** Name, positon (top), flashing (time, status), rect
** Flashing effect, writing

Next steps:
* UI + progress bar (rows_generated / max_row)
** Progeress bar
** Highscore
* Background fade in/out in steps
* Move Background class to UI file


Deadpool:
* Each cell has lifetime
* If lifetime <= 0 -> kill it
* Else - update color




*RPG model:
** Finishing levels gives you points and you can buy upgrades with them
** You can choose level (harder levels = more points)
** Upgrades like better ammo (universal, double)
** Skills (after pressing key something happens - maib_blob stopped for x second, recolor blob_part, delete row, move upgoing blob to side...)
