TODO:
Comments + clean up code
Project header (licence, author, ...)
Up-going blobs (see bellow)
When destroying cell, brighter flash fo a moment (50ms?)
Universal ammo
Ammo of two colors
Setting & difficulties


Fails:
Exe file - I need a help with this! (Python 3.5, Pyinstaller doesn't work (even when commenting out the pictures) - it creates exe, which crashes to desktop)
Add sounds (hit, bounce, miss, reload, empty - there is too much latency :-( )


Code cleaning ideas:
* Lables as instances of class
** Name, positon (top), flashing (time, status), rect
** Flashing effect, writing

* Random colors as separate function
** Takes arguments list and max, generates from [0,max)
** Generate tips separate, takes and returns also positon (so tips can be always changed)

* Separate constants and settings variables



Feature ideas:
* Up-going blob:
** Subclass of blob
** One color (+ Nones)
** First generate, then randomly choose first column
** Destroy when leaving screen
** It covers main_blob + acts as part of it for purpose of hit spreading
** For spreading of hit I can use corners of cell (collision, color comparing) -> if cell_collides_with_lower_blob and lower_blob[x,y] == color then cell.damage()


*RPG model:
** Finishing levels gives you points and you can buy upgrades with them
** You can choose level (harder levels = more points)
** Upgrades like better ammo (universal, double)
** Skills (after pressing key something happens - maib_blob stopped for x second, recolor blob_part, delete row, ...)
