Exe file - I need a help with this! (Python 3.5, Pyinstaller doesn't work (even when commenting out the pictures) - it creates exe, which crashes to desktop)



Ideas:
* Up-going blob:
** Subclass of blob
** One color (+ Nones)
** First generate, then randomly choose first column
** Destroy when leaving screen
** It covers main_blob + acts as part of it for purpose of hit spreading
** For spreading of hit I can use corners of cell (collision, color comparing) -> if cell_collides_with_lower_blob and lower_blob[x,y] == color then cell.damage()
